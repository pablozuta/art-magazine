        <p>Experience a new film installation by North West based artist Emily Speed. The film is inspired by Edwin
          Abbott’s 1884 novella Flatland, a satire of Victorian society, where all existence is limited to two

        <h4>Grief, Trauma, Love</h4><br>

        <p>And I love the kind of ongoing love affair, aesthetically and politically, between Black Americans and Puerto
          Ricans. There’s been so much synergy, especially in the Bronx, in East Harlem, Lower East Side, and parts of
          Brooklyn. </p>

        <p>Can architecture and design write scenarios for the next generation of work? What will it take to anticipate

        <p>Contemporary public space projects should address both the digital and the physical layer of a place. The two

  <p class="p-text">They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that
    completely covered
    the hull of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions,
    kneejerk responses.
    Case felt the edge of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a painted
    jungle of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the room where Case waited.

  <br>
  <p class="p-text">Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the previous century. He stared
    at the rear of
    the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console.
    No light but the muted purring of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void beyond the hull. A
    Dali clock hung on the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the Tank War, mouth touched with
    hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the
    bare concrete floor.

  <p class="p-text">After the postoperative check at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard
    and the
    dripping chassis of a gutted game console. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a ritual lack
    of urgency through the center of his closed left eyelid.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text">Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the arcade showed him broken lengths
    of damp
    chipboard and the drifting shoals of waste. Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck
    currents set up by the blowers and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his capsule
    in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="p-text">The knives seemed to have been sparsely decorated, years before, with a luminous digital display
    wired to a
    subcutaneous chip. Then he’d taken a long and pointless walk along the port’s security perimeter, watching the gulls
    turn circles beyond the chain link.
    Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the
    blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. Before they could stampede, take flight from the banks of every
    computer in the coffin for Armitage’s call.

        <h4>Emily Speed</h4><br>
             
        <p >Experience a new film installation by North West based artist Emily Speed. The film is inspired by Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella Flatland, a satire of Victorian society, where all existence is limited to two dimensions and women are restricted to thin, straight lines. </p>

          <p class="parrafo2">Such marks make the image oscillate back and forth, back into the process of miniature making and forward into a Modernist frame. The reverse gear refers to the initial stage of drawing exercises: an exquisitely laborious procedure whereby the miniature student spends hours, days and nights, simply drawing parallel lines into square inch boxes with the razor sharp point of an extra hard pencil. </p>

          <p >And I love the kind of ongoing love affair, aesthetically and politically, between Black Americans and Puerto Ricans. There’s been so much synergy, especially in the Bronx, in East Harlem, Lower East Side, and parts of Brooklyn. And so in the mid-’70s, there were all these art collectives forming around Puerto Rican identity and really direct-action organizations.</p>

            <p class="parrafo2">Can architecture and design write scenarios for the next generation of work? What will it take to anticipate and formulate work environments and experiences that are productive, humane, and ecologically responsible? “No Sweat” challenges designers to speculate on the spaces of work in an accelerated future, and to imagine a world in which a novel ethics of labor can emerge.</p>

            <p class="parrafo2">Contemporary public space projects should address both the digital and the physical layer of a place. The two are becoming increasingly interconnected and dependent on each other. Designers should awaken to the opport­unities emerging from their interaction and develop new ways of working that challenge the existing professional conventions. </p>
